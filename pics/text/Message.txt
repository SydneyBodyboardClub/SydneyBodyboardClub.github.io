Hi,
As you know I have been working on the website for a little bit now for school and for the club. I have a few queeries which I would like your input on.

1.
	Should I keep the next comp message?
	should I add anything else?

2. Contact Page:

	Who would you like to be put on the table?

3. Leaderboard Page: 
	
	So far I have put it into a top 5 table with a scoring system that follows: 1st: 100pts, 2nd: 80pts, 	3rd: 80pts and so on. Is there anything I should include or change? 

	I need a list of who came 1,2,3,4(,5 potentially) in comp 2 as there was never results put on fb.

4. Sponsors:
	
	What sponsors are to be included into the dropdown list?
	
	Should there be a write up about sponsors, or maybe a ad on the side for a major sponsor?

5. About Page:

	The little write up, is that too much, any critisisms?
	
	The Commitee section: Should we keep it, if we do we need to get better photos, also should I only 		include pres and vice-pres?

	Competition dates: I did the first sunday of each month... (which is wrong). How many comps are 		there per year and on what days.

6. Anything else.

	What else should I include on the website?


Problems:
	1. Making the website responsive.
	2. Unsafe scripts (for the back to top button)



Thanks.. 
Trent
